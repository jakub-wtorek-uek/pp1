# 8.	Natural values 5, 1, 8, 6, 3 have been assigned to variables named: n1, n2, n3, n4, n5. Using only variables, create the following expressions:
# a.	sum of all variables.
# b.	sum of squared variables.
# c.	quotient of the variable three and five.
# d.	display a message(True / False) indicating if the third variable is equal to the fourth.

n1 = 5
n2 = 1
n3 = 8
n4 = 6
n5 = 3

# a
print(n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)

# b
print(n1 ** 2 + n2 ** 2 + n3 ** 2 + n4 ** 2 + n5 ** 2)

# c
print(n3 / n5)

# d
print(n3 == n5)
